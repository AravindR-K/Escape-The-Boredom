This duck was special, as she laid four eggs, each promising new life. After a few days of patient waiting, all four eggs hatched, revealing adorable ducklings eager to explore the world.
                        Three of the ducklings resembled their mother, with soft yellow feathers and bright eyes. The fourth duckling, however, looked vastly different. He was larger, with grey feathers and a somber expression.As the days passed, the other ducklings started teasing him, calling him ugly and making him feel out of place. The poor duckling felt sad and lonely, longing for acceptance and companionship.

There, amidst the gentle flow of the water, he saw a group of swans gliding gracefully. Their pure white feathers and elegant movements mesmerized him, and he wished he could be as beautiful as they were.
                        In his despair, the duckling contemplated drowning himself in the river. But as he gazed at his reflection, something miraculous happened. The duckling realized that the creature staring back at him was not an ugly duckling but a beautiful swan!</p></div>
