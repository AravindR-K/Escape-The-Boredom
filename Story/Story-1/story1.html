                    He often just roared and killed animals, even when he was not very hungry. The terrified animals of the jungle one day called for a meeting. “We must put and end to this menace,” 
                    Forro fox cried. “But how,” wondered the other animals. “Terro is so big and strong, none of can even touch him. I guess we will have to just live with this, more likely die with this!”
                    But Buns Rabbit was not the kind to give up. He thought of a plan. </p></div>

                        Buns Rabbit says he has seen someone even more powerful than you.” Upon hearing this Terro Lion roared. He asked Merry to go and send Buns Rabbit to him.
                        The clever Buns came up to Terro. “Hey Buns, you puny fellow," roared Terro. "What's all this nonsense about a more powerful lion than me in the jungle?" 
                        Buns said, “My lord, you are indeed mighty. Forgive me, I am just telling what I saw. I saw a huge lion yesterday.” Terro roared aloud,

                        There is no one more mighty than me. Take me to him.”The clever Buns took Terro to a lake. He then pointed to the water in the lake and said, “My lord, I saw the huge lion cooling off in this lake.”
                        Terro peeped into the water. He saw his own face in the water. He roared loudly. He saw his image in the water roaring back at him. He was so angry, that he forgot everything, even that he didn't know how to swim.
                        “How dare you roar back at mighty me. I will finish you.” He cried and jumped right into the lake. Terro drowned.</p></div>
