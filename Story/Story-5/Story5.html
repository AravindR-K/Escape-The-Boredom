As he dozed peacefully, a playful mouse scurried about, using the lion's massive body as a playground.
                        The mouse's tiny feet tickled the lion's fur, waking him from his slumber with a start. Enraged by the disturbance, the lion sprang to his feet, his eyes blazing with anger.
                        With a swift paw, the lion trapped the mouse under his massive paw, ready to devour it in one swift bite. Trembling with fear, the mouse implored, "Please, mighty lion, spare my life! I may be small, but I promise, one day I will repay your kindness."</p>

"You, help me? How could such a tiny creature ever be of assistance to a lion like me?" Despite his doubts, the lion decided to let the mouse go, amused by its bravado.
                        Some time later, a group of hunters ventured into the forest, armed with nets and traps. They spotted the lion, a majestic beast, and quickly set their traps, capturing him and binding him tightly to a tree. The lion roared in fury, his mighty roar echoing through the trees as he struggled against his bonds.</p></div>
