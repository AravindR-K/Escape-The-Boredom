### 3. Hangman
A word guessing game where you try to guess the word one letter at a time. Each incorrect guess results in a part of the hangman being drawn.

#### Instructions:
- The game displays a series of blank spaces representing the letters in the word.
- Suggest a letter.
- If the letter is in the word, it fills in the blank spaces.
- If the letter is not in the word, a part of the hangman is drawn.
- Use already revealed letters to guess the remaining ones.
- Complete the word before the hangman drawing is fully completed.
- The game is lost if the hangman drawing is completed before guessing the word.
