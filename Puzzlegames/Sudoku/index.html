            Starting Grid: Some numbers are already filled in the grid. These are the "clues" that provide a starting point.
            
            Gameplay:
            
            Use logic and deduction to fill in the empty squares with numbers from 1 to 9.
            Numbers cannot be repeated in any row, column, or 3x3 subgrid.
            Strategies:
            
            Start with easier numbers and work towards more complex placements.
            Use elimination and scanning techniques to identify where numbers can fit based on existing placements.

            Completion:

Complete the grid by filling in all empty squares without repeating any numbers in rows, columns, or subgrids.
Every row, column, and 3x3 subgrid should contain numbers 1 to 9 with no repeats.
